/**
 * Special implementation of {@link FileDeleter} that can be used if your project is using JNA library. When set
 * to file chooser using {@link FileChooser#setFileDeleter(FileDeleter)}, when user deletes file it will be moved
 * to trash instead of being deleted permanently. This also changes chooser texts to ensure that user knows that file
 * is moved to trash. Trying to create this class without JNA will result in {@link ClassNotFoundException}s.
 * <p>
 * Note that user system may not support trash even if JNA is used, in that case file chooser behaviour won't be changed.
